# libs
====

Repository of several open libraries used in projects.

Spent a fair amount of time trying to use package managers to handle libraries and realised that libraries are too important and diverse to automate and in reality they do deserve careful attention. Plus the fact that every library has different development methodologies, applications, communities, etc and later on is hard to find previous/old 'compiled' versions.

So here is where we take care of the libraries that we use. We have adopted a folder structure to use in an application to make it easy for maintenance (and automation with Grunt):

```
app/
└── libs/
    ├── css
    ├── fonts
    ├── img
    └── js
```
