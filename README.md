libs
====

Repository of several open libraries used in projects.

Spent a fair amount of time trying to use package managers to handle libraries and realised that libraries are too important and diverse to automate and in reality they do deserve careful attention. Plus the fact that every library has different development methodologies, applications, communities, etc, etc.

So here is where we take care of the libraries that we use. We adopted a folder structure to use in an application so that libraries matches that structure:

/libs
  /css
  /fonts
  /img
  /js
